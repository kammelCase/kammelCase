### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. My name is Mark Raafat Kammel. 
### ðŸ’» I'm a Creative Director with a passion for Data Science.
I started to code when I wanted to automate and create some generative artwork in Blender. But once I found Data Science, that was a wrap. For me, it felt almost identical to the process of creating documentaries but turned up to 11. Now, I want to bring my 10+ years of experience as a founder and documentary filmmaker to the world of Data Science.

I believe Data Science can be a major force for good in our world. If your project/company works towards that, then I'm all in.
